# Mckinsey-Forward-Program---Learning-Reflections-and-Intentions-Blog from Foundation Level (L1)

## I) Most relevant learnings

I will categorize my most relevant learnings into two:
* Data Analytics
* Robotic Process Automation

### Data Analytics

The importance of data analytics in the business space cannot be overemphasized. My foreknowledge about this concept and the lessons gleaned from the course were a real eye-opener to the promise of analytics. 

1. Data strategy,  company's approach to data sources and formats..
2. Data architecture - pipelines for integration and distribution of the data.
3. Data governance - guidelines to manage data and  quality.
4. Data culture - implementation by end users to make decisions.
5. Data ethics - the regulations when dealing with data.

Summarily, utilization of data helps identify trends in companyâ€™s target and actual sales over a given period. Enable discovery of solutions to resolve existing challenges. Create  innovative strategies that appeal to more clints.

### Robotics Process Automation (RPA)

In line with the four fundamental principles of agile, digital transformation aims to drive continuous value. RPA is a technology-driven solution used to reduce manual tasks and get the best of the employees by allowing them to innovate rather than doing monotonous work. Researh has shown that RPA and digital transformation can save approx 30-35% of companies' costs being spent on non-productive and repetitive tasks. 

## II) Learning Intentions

With the knowledge I gained so far, I intend to use data-driven approaches in acheiving tasks. I have obtained tools like Microsoft Power BI, for visiualization;  utilizing excel tools such as pivot tables, for data analyses; UiPath, for robotic process automation. I have been able to automate some of my repetitive tasks at work with bots and have introduced the concept to management for possible implementation.
